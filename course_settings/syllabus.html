<h4><strong>Course Materials</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Required Textbook:</strong></h5>
<p><img src="$IMS-CC-FILEBASE$/textbook.jpg?canvas_download=1&amp;canvas_qs_wrap=1" alt="" width="150" height="188" data-decorative="true" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><em>Basics of Web Design HTML5 &amp; CSS</em>&nbsp;5th edition by Terry Felke-Morris</p>
<p>ISBN-13: 9780135225486</p>
<p class="p1">Student files can be downloaded by going to</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/bc/abp/cs-resources/products/product.html#product,isbn=0135225485">https://media.pearsoncmg.com/bc/abp/cs-resources/products/product.html#product,isbn=0135225485</a></p>
<p class="p2">then click on "Companion Website" link. &nbsp;The companion website provides the image and video files for the case study assignments, solutions for all hands-on practices, and VideoNotes created by the author for all chapters. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Required Software:</strong></h5>
<p>Development Environment:</p>
<p>In order for the course to be consistent for all students, this course will require that you use a text editor (e.g. Notepad++, sublime text 3).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Office 2013 or higher (Word) or Google Word for Mac</strong></p>
<p>During the course you will have weekly project submissions. These project files are typically Word documents that you will need to save/edit/submit by the due date.</p>
<h4><strong>Expectations</strong></h4>
<p>The topics in this class can be fun and allow for personal creativity, however, you should be aware that many topics build on previous ones. Some students have more computer experience than others and will find the topics easy to master while others will need time for experimenting and practicing.</p>
<p>To be successful work on the materials as soon as possible after they open, do the assignments early so you have enough time to complete them, and read/watch all of the assigned material. I’m here to assist you so email me your questions as soon as you can.</p>
<p><strong>All the work is due by 11:59 PM Arizona time on the due date and assignment files should be submitted to Canvas by 11:55 PM Arizona time. No late work will be accepted and internet/computer failure is not an acceptable excuse for not doing the work.</strong> Make sure you have a second option in the event you experience an internet/computer issue.</p>
<p>Make up work requires documentation for a university excused absence (ACD Accommodation for Religious Practices 304–04, Missed Classes Due to University-Sanctioned Activities ACD 304–02). Accommodations will be made for students with religious holidays. Below is the calendar of official religious holidays. Each holiday noted with two asterisks denotes an observance for which work is not allowed. For these holidays, students will not be penalized in any way for missing class or assignment. This means that this will not count as an absence in class and they will be granted a makeup assignment. <a href="https://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays">https://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays</a></p>
<p>All requests for accommodation must be submitted by the end of the second week of class.</p>
<p>Medical and death of a family member are also available for excused absences but written dated documentation is required. Other classes and work are not acceptable excuses for missing course work.</p>
<p>Students requesting accommodation for a disability must be registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) and submit appropriate documentation from the DRC before a scheduled exam is opened in Canvas.</p>
<h4><strong>Assessment</strong></h4>
<p>Your course grade will be based on your performance on a combination of quizzes/exams and MyEducator assignments. The following weights will be applied to each grade category:</p>

<h5><strong>Quiz Policy</strong></h5>
<p>Quizzes will be open from the first day of the week at 12:00 AM Arizona time and will close the last day of the week at 11:59 PM Arizona time on the week in which it is due. The weekly class schedule table can be found in the end of this syllabus.</p>
<p>Quizzes are open note/book/resource.</p>
<p>Each quiz will consist of 25 multiple choice &amp; true/false questions. Questions will be displayed 1 (one) at a time and randomly from a large pool of questions (no exam will be the same). You will be unable to go back to a previous question after you have answered it. You will have 20 minutes to complete each quiz. If you go over the allotted 25 minutes your quiz/exam will automatically submit and your will receive the grade recorded. Since the quizzes are open all week, it is your responsibility to make sure your quiz is completed by the date and time it is due. <strong>No retakes will be given on missed quizzes – no exceptions</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure you are on a computer and internet connection that is stable. Additional quiz attempts will only be given in the event that there is a system wide outage that is documented by the University Technology Office on <a href="https://syshealth.asu.edu/">https://syshealth.asu.edu</a>.</p>
<h5><strong>Case Study Policy</strong></h5>
<p>Case Studies submission links will be open from the first day of the week at 12:00 AM Arizona time and will close the last day of the week at 11:59 PM Arizona time on the week in which it is due. The weekly class schedule table can be found in the end of this syllabus.</p>
<p>Case studies are to be completed on your own and adhere to the academic integrity policies of the course.</p>
<p>During most of the weeks, you will be covering 2 chapters (both have a case study). Each chapter that has a case study builds upon the case study from the previous chapter. <strong>Your final weekly submission will be the case study files from the last chapter covered during the week.</strong></p>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure you are on a computer and internet connection that is stable. <strong>Extensions on case studies will only be given in the event that there is a system wide outage that is documented by the University Technology Office on </strong><a href="https://syshealth.asu.edu/">https://syshealth.asu.edu</a>.</p>
<h5><strong>Project Deliverables Information and Policy</strong></h5>
<p>Project Deliverable submission links will be closed 11:59 PM Arizona time on the day in which it is due.</p>
<p>Projects deliverables are to be completed on your own and adhere to the academic integrity policies of the course.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Web Project Case Study is to design a website using recommended design practices. Your website might be about a favorite hobby or subject, your family, a church or club you belong to, a company that a friend owns, the company you work for, and so on. Your website will contain a home page and at least six (but no more than eight) content pages. The Web Project Case Study provides an outline for a semester-long project in which you design, create, and publish an original website.</p>
<p>For this project, you will have a total of 7 deliverables spread out throughout the course:</p>
<ol>
<li>Project Topic Approval</li>
<li>Project Planning Analysis Sheet</li>
<li>Project Site Map</li>
<li>Project Page Layout Design</li>
<li>Project Update #1</li>
<li>Project Update #2</li>
<li>Project Publish and Discuss</li>
</ol>
<p>The project deliverables make up 50% of your final grade, so make sure you complete them. A grading rubric will be provided for each deliverable so you can see what you will be graded on. It is VERY important that you begin working on this project at the start of the course. For more information about each deliverable, please see the information at the end of Chapter 3 in your textbook.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure you are on a computer and internet connection that is stable. Extensions on final project deliverables will only be given in the event that there is a system wide outage that is documented by the University Technology Office on <a href="https://syshealth.asu.edu/">https://syshealth.asu.edu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>For the #7. Project Publish and Discuss:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Depend on your file size, the submission may take up to 1 ½ hours. Please submit your project publish and discuss assignment files around 10:00 pm Arizona time on the day in which it is due.</strong> <strong>You will not get any message from Canvas until it is finished uploading your deliverables. Contact the Help Desk at (855) 278-5080 if you run into problems. They are open 24 x 7. Then, email me to let me know.</strong></p>
<p>While working through the project publish and discuss assignment, keep the following requirements in mind for your final deliverable (you will be learning about all of this throughout the course):</p>

<h4>Instructor’s Suggestions for succeeding in the Course</h4>
<p>My goal is for every student to succeed in this course! Accordingly, I will do whatever I can to be available to answer questions, to explain concepts in alternative ways, and to revisit prior material. I will also try hard to make this class interesting. However, it is very possible for you to receive a poor (or failing) grade by ignoring the following suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start working on assignments/quizzes/exams as soon as you can so you have time to ask questions and complete the assignments/quizzes/exams on time</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Ask early (and often) if you need help:</strong> Unlike many other online instructors, I’m am on the Tempe Campus typically every day of the week during business hours. Feel free to stop by and ask questions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Log into the course daily:</strong> This course will go by extremely quick. If you are not logging in daily, you are likely to miss something.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pay attention/read announcements:</strong> I will periodically send out announcements, please read them. They are really for your benefit, not mine.</li>
<li><strong>Read and respond to course email messages as needed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Create a study and/or assignment schedule to stay on track</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Syllabus and Schedule Disclaimer</strong></h4>
<p>The syllabus is a statement of intent and serves as an implicit agreement between the instructor and the student. Every effort will be made to avoid changing the course schedule but the possibility exists that unforeseen events will make syllabus changes necessary. Please remember to check your ASU email and the course site often.</p>
<h4><strong>Appeals of Grading</strong></h4>
<p>If you wish to appeal grading for any portion of the course, this should be done by writing a brief email message or letter that explains your concerns. The purpose of a written appeal is to allow the instructor to find the student’s grade (from among those of numerous current students) and to then consider the appeal on its merits without distraction. Student grade appeals will be reviewed quickly and fairly.</p>
<p>Appeals concerning validity of quiz questions or posted answers must be made within 48 hours of quiz close date.</p>
<p>Other types of grade appeals must be made within 3 days of the time your grade posted. It is <strong>your responsibility</strong> to verify grades in Canvas and signal discrepancies to your instructor at your earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p>Once the appeal period has passed for any given quiz/assignment, the instructor will not accept appeal requests.</p>
<h4><strong>Backing Up Your Work</strong></h4>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining backups of all your assignments as you work through them. I highly suggest the use of a flash drive and/or a cloud storage provider so you have two copies of your data. If you choose not to take preventative disaster recovery measures, you still remain responsible for on-time submission of your assignments.</p>
<h4><strong>Course Website</strong></h4>
<p>Course assignments, documents, and information will be available on the class web site at <a>http://canvas.asu.edu</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Email/Online Communication</strong></h4>
<p>All communication via email should be professional in form, content, and tone. That means that the message should have a subject indicating it is for CIS300 and begin with a salutation and the body should explain the purpose of the message in clear English and give a complete description of the problem or situation you are writing about. The message should be signed with your full name, student ID, and include the section you are in. Please do not write to ask for information that is contained in the course syllabus and schedule (e.g., grading policies, due dates, etc.).</p>
<h4><strong>Drop and Add Dates/Withdrawals</strong></h4>
<p>This course adheres to a compressed schedule and may be part of a sequenced program, therefore, there is a limited timeline to <a href="https://students.asu.edu/academic-calendar">drop or add the course</a>. Consult with your advisor and notify your instructor to add or drop this course. If you are considering a withdrawal, review the following ASU policies: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm201-08.html">Withdrawal from Classes</a>, <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm201-09.html">Medical/Compassionate Withdrawal</a>, and a <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm203-09.html">Grade of Incomplete</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Academic Integrity</strong></h4>
<p>Prior to having access to any of the course material, you will be required to read, understand, and agree to the Academic Integrity Policies of ASU, W. P. Carey School of Business, and this CIS 300 course. Additional information about the Academic Integrity Policies in this course, W. P. Carey, and ASU will be discussed in the "Start Here" section.</p>
<p>From the <strong>ASU General Catalog</strong>: “The highest standards of academic integrity are expected of all students. Failure to meet these standards may result in suspension or expulsion from the university and other sanctions as specified in the academic integrity policies of the individual colleges. <strong><em>Violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to cheating, fabrication, tampering, plagiarism, or facilitating such activities…”</em></strong> Specific policies can be found at: <a href="http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity">http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity</a>.</p>
<p>The term “facilitating” includes active or inactive participation in academic dishonesty. Inactive participation includes silent knowledge of violations. This policy relates to all assignments, quizzes, and exams for this course. Please be forewarned that your instructor strongly agrees with this policy, will strive to actively enforce it, and will support punishment for those who violate it.</p>
<p>Protect your assignments/quizzes/exams. Don’t leave files on the hard drives of school computers; don’t share your files, answers, etc. with others.</p>
<p>Expect to be called in for an interview with the instructor if your assignments/quizzes/exams are flagged for academic integrity violations.</p>
<h4><strong>CIS 300 Academic Integrity Policies</strong></h4>
<p>There is something to be said about the saying two heads are better than one. When it comes to learning how to build a website, collaboration is key. With that being said, this course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "<strong>be reasonable</strong>." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains <strong>a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another</strong>. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.</p>
<p><strong>The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own</strong>. Collaboration on assignments and/or the final project is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when asking for help, <strong>you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs</strong>.</p>
<p>Below are rules of thumb that (in exhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it and remember you can always ask me for help.</p>
<h5>Reasonable</h5>
<ul>
<li>Communicating with classmates about assignment/final project problems in English (or some other spoken language).</li>
<li>Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.</li>
<li>Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.</li>
<li>Incorporating snippets of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those snippets are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the snippets' origins.</li>
<li>Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.</li>
<li>Sharing snippets of your own code on Reddit or elsewhere so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.</li>
<li>Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set's problems or your own final project.</li>
<li>White boarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.</li>
<li>Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Not Reasonable</h5>
<ul>
<li>Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.</li>
<li>Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set's problem before (re-)submitting your own.</li>
<li>Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.</li>
<li>Giving or showing to a classmate your solution to a problem set's problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.</li>
<li>Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.</li>
<li>Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.</li>
<li>Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere.</li>
<li>Splitting a problem set's workload with another individual and combining your work.</li>
<li>Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond allowed snippets.</li>
<li>Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.</li>
<li>Viewing another's solution to a problem set's problem and basing your own solution on it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the event you are flagged for academic integrity issues, the instructor will proceed with the following course of action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are found in violation of the course's policies on a case study or quiz, you will receive a <strong><em>0 on the assignment and a 2 letter grade reduction</em></strong> for the first offense.</li>
<li>If you are found in violation of the course's policies more than once on a case study or quiz, you will receive an automatic failing grade in the course and the <strong><em>instructor will recommend the letter grade of "XE" (Failure due to Academic Dishonesty)</em></strong> be placed on your transcript. An "XE" will prohibit you from representing the University in any extracurricular activity or run for (or hold) office in any recognized student organization. During this time frame, you will be unable to represent the University in any extracurricular activity or run for (or hold) office in any recognized student organization.</li>
<li>If you are found in violations of the course's policies on any of the final project deliverables, you will receive an automatic failing grade for the course.</li>
</ul>
<h4>In summary:</h4>
<p>The W. P. Carey School takes academic integrity very seriously. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, it is imperative that you do your own work. Any suspected violations of academic integrity will be taken seriously and result in the following sanctions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimum of zero on the assignment OR</li>
<li>A reduced grade in the course OR</li>
<li>A failure in the course OR</li>
<li>An XE which denotes failure due to academic dishonesty on the transcript OR</li>
<li>Removal from the W. P. Carey School of Business</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional information on ASU’s academic integrity policy may be found at <a href="http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity">http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity</a></p>
<h5>Additional Ethics Policy</h5>
<p>By law and regulation, this class will be conducted within the ethical standards of the university at large, which promote tolerance and preclude such activities as plagiarism, cheating, unfair grading, and various forms of harassment.</p>
<p>The Undergraduate Student Honor Code information can be found at: <a href="https://students.wpcarey.asu.edu/resources/honor-code">https://students.wpcarey.asu.edu/resources/honor-code</a></p>
<p>Be aware that business, when practiced effectively, has ethics that go beyond the university standards. <strong><em>These are ethics that are aimed at creating collegiality.</em></strong> The goal is to make customers, employees, managers, and vendors feel happy and satisfied...not just tolerated! This class will follow business ethics as well as university regulations.</p>
<h4>Prohibition Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation</h4>
<p>Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited. An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university. If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at <a href="https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs">https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs</a>.</p>
<p>As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence. ASU Counseling Services, <a href="https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling">https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling</a>, is available if you wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately.</p>
<h4><strong>Religious Accommodations</strong></h4>
<p>Accommodations will be made for students with religious holidays. Below is the calendar of official religious holidays. Each holiday noted with two asterisks denotes an observance for which work is not allowed. For these holidays, students will not be penalized in any way for missing class or assignment. This means that this will not count as an absence in class and they will be granted a makeup assignment or exam, etc. <a href="https://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays">https://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays</a></p>
<p>All requests for accommodation must be submitted by the end of the second week of class.</p>
<h4><strong>University-Sanctioned Activities</strong></h4>
<p>Accommodations will be made for students who miss class related to university-sanctioned activities according to ACD 304-02.</p>
<p>If you are participating in a university-sanctioned activity, please let your instructor know as early in the course as possible so that accommodations can be made.</p>
<h4><strong>Tutoring Support</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>There is no tutoring support for this class. Email all your questions to your instructors.</li>
<li>Please note that the W. P. Carey School of Business provides free tutoring in BA 201 for a number of undergraduate business classes. Assistance with writing is also provided.</li>
