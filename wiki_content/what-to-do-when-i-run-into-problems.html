<h4>To use Chrome Developer Tools</h4>
<p>If you are using a text editor, view your html file in Google Chrome browser. Right click on the html file and open it in Google Chrome.</p>
<p>Once your html file is displayed in a chrome browser, move your mouse to the page location where you are having "troubles, right click to select "Inspect" to open Google Chrome Developer Tools. You will see both the html code under the Elements option and CSS code under the Styles option. It is a great tool to see which style properties have been applied to those html code. <a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV9PLPFTnkE" target="_blank" data-preview-alt="Using Chrome Developer Tools: Elements (1/6)">Using Chrome Developer Tools: Elements (1/6)</a><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iyLb1DkoTZRFYRAl4yoOHApFma_-AuJ7/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"></a> provides more info in how to use Google Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
<h4>Email Your Instructor</h4>
<p>When email me with your questions, please provide the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>The file name that you are having questions.</li>
<li>Explain what problems you run into. Screenshots will be great.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please do NOT just email me your code without explaining what problems you have. I would like to explain to you what might be the reasons that cause the problems so we can figure out the solution together vs just making changes to your code. Even you don't think my suggestions are the answer, I highly recommend you to give my suggestions a try. If none of the suggestions work, I will ask you to email me your code.</p>
