<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The following video is completely optional and is not required for this course. Getting a website online (buying a domain and setting up hosting) costs money, so this is only provided for information purposes. ASU, W. P. Carey, and the instructor can not be held responsible for any technical issues you experience and/or any cost associated with you setting up a domain and/or hosting.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that you will be personally responsible for anything you make public online. Make sure you are fully aware of copyright/trademark issues surrounding publishing content. Please take all necessary precautions to ensure any content you publish is owned by yourself or you have received permission/license to use content owned by another individual or organization. If you are unsure, please seek professional legal advice from an attorney (ASU, W. P. Carey, and your instructor are not qualified to provide you with legal advice).</p>
<p>Hopefully that didn't scare you away... it wasn't meant to, I just want to make sure you are aware it isn't part of the course and that it is completely on you to ensure you are doing the right things.</p>
