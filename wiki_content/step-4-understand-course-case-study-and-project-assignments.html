<h4><strong>Case Study Description:</strong></h4>
<p>Pacific Trails Resort</p>
<p>Throughout this course you will need to complete the Pacific Trails Resort case study at the end of each chapter. These case studies serve as a way to reinforce the skills discussed within each chapter.</p>
<ol>
<li>At the end of each week, you will be required to create a ZIP file of your case study folder and submit it via the submission link below.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The case study folder should be named with yourasurite-ch#CS with # as the chapter number, e.g. for my week 1 case study assignment the folder name will be selin2-ch2CS. Make sure the zip file you submit to Canvas includes yourasurite, otherwise 25 points will be deducted from your final score.</li>
<li>Each chapter's case study, except chapters 1 and 3, will build&nbsp;upon the previous chapter's case study files. You <strong>ONLY</strong> need to submit the <strong>LAST </strong>chapter of the week's case study files when you submit or you will not get full credit. For example, in Week 3, we will work on Chapters 5 and 6's case study assignments. Only the folder that has chapter 6 files needs to be zipped and submitted.</li>
<li>Each chapter's case study builds upon the prior case study work that you have done. By copying your previous weeks files, from its folder, to the next chapter folder allows you to keep a copy of your previous work (in case you need to start over) and saves you the time/effort of doing everything from scratch.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you get to the case study, finish the items listed under Task section, prepare files created to be submitted, and click on the submission link to submit the zipped case study file. Click on the "Browse" button to find your case study zipped file after you click on the submission link. Then, click the "Submit Assignment" button. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please do not wait until 11:55 pm to submit the zipped file. </strong>The internet may not have enough time to finish uploading your file. In that case, you will <strong>NOT</strong> get any points because <strong>NO</strong> late or email submission is allowed in this course.</p>
