<h4><strong>Important Course Notes:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Access and read the <a title="Course Syllabus" href="$CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE$/assignments/syllabus">Syllabus.</a></li>
<li>This is a condensed course. This course requires the same weekly time commitment as taking two courses. Rather than taking two courses simultaneously over 15 weeks, you are taking two courses sequentially over 7.5 weeks.</li>
<li>You will need the <a href="#textbook">textbook</a> for the weekly case study. Please purchase the textbook as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Weekly case study will be based on the previous week's case study work. Please make sure you are not behind in any week's case study assignment.</li>
<li>For this class, <strong>no email submission</strong> is allowed and <strong>no late submission</strong> is allowed. Please plan enough time to finish all assignments and submit your assignment <strong>before 11:55 pm</strong> to give the Internet enough time to finish uploading your assignment to Canvas.</li>
<li>Each quiz is <strong>30 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li>Quiz, Case Study submission links, and Project assignment submission links are available <strong>until the last day of that course week @ 11:59 pm</strong>.</li>
<li>No project assignment for week 1 but <strong>2 project assignments for Week 4.</strong></li>
<li>To work on Case Study and Project assignments, install a text editor (such as Notepad ++ for Windows or Sublime for both Windows and Mac).</li>
<li>You can watch the video <a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xe4D_T_WN0">How to Watch YouTube Videos at 2x Speed</a> to learn how to adjust the speed of the videos. I would recommend only adjusting it to a max of 1.25 (any more makes me sound like a chipmunk and you can't understand the video well).</li>

<p>In an online course, the schedule is more flexible than a face-to-face course, which makes it more important than ever to be self-disciplined, and to keep on top of things. It is easy to fall behind, so make sure this doesn't happen to you. Be sure to log in to the classroom every day!</p>

<h3>Course Materials</h3>
<p><strong>Development Environment:</strong></p>
<p>In order for the course to be consistent for all students, this course will require that you use a text editor (e.g. Notepad++, sublime text 3, or any text editor you are familiar with).</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Office 2013 or higher (Word) or Google Word for Mac</strong></p>
<p>During the course you will have weekly project submissions. These project files are typically Word documents that you will need to save/edit/submit by the due date.</p>

<p>Because we will not have regular face-to-face class sessions, it is very important that you find ways to stay internally disciplined, organized, and motivated. Here are some tips to be successful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the course daily, to stay in touch with the material and activities and keep them fresh in your mind.</li>
<li>Read all announcements! This is the only way your instructor can update you on any new course information. Announcements will be sent to your ASU email address. (The one that ends with @asu.edu.) If you do not check this email regularly, you will need to be sure to start. If you have set your Canvas settings not to receive announcements by email, then you need to be sure to check the announcements within the course. You are responsible for knowing the content of the announcements posted in the course.</li>
<li>Create a personal organization system, such as a calendar, a to-do list, smartphone reminders, or some other organizational tool, to keep track of due dates specified. (Canvas's calendar may be able to help, if you like this format.)</li>
<li>Communicate regularly with your instructor and peers.</li>
<li>Create a study and/or assignment schedule to stay on track. This is an online course, and the pace goes very quickly. For a 3-credit course, the expectation is that students will spend about 135 hours on the material through the semester. For various course lengths, this breaks down as follows:
<table border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Course Length</th>
<th scope="col">Approximate # of hours <br>required per week</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Summer A or B (6 weeks)</td>
<td>~23</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Summer C (8 weeks)</td>
<td>~17</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fall/Spring A or B (7.5 weeks)</td>
<td>~18</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fall/Spring C (16 weeks)</td>
<td>~9</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Of course, the actual amount of time you need may vary based on a lot of factors, but it would be wise to clear your schedule of the appropriate number of hours per week, in order to give yourself the best chance of doing well in this course.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set aside regular times in which you can do your classwork with minimal interruptions or distractions. Avoid multi-tasking while doing online studying. Treat this with the same respect as you would a face-to-face class environment.</li>
<li>Copy and paste discussion board posts into a text document on your personal computer before submitting them. Technical glitches in Canvas, while rare, do happen, and it is frustrating to lose hours of work.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where do I go if I need help?</h4>
<p>Being an online student can be challenging. Knowing where to turn when a question arises is important in mitigating the challenge. You have several resources available to you for help. The primary ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course materials</li>
<li>The instructor</li>
<li><a title="Course FAQ" href="$WIKI_REFERENCE$/pages/g1ff67c8b131cf912fc39d57a05e3cb7c" data-api-endpoint="https://asu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/105269/pages/course-faq" data-api-returntype="Page">Course FAQ</a></li>
<li><a title="Hallway Conversations" href="$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/discussion_topics/gcac6604b5197323c619e19086dbe144f" data-api-endpoint="https://asu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/105269/discussion_topics/2964611" data-api-returntype="Discussion">Hallway Conversations</a></li>
<li>ASU Help Desk</li>
<li>ASU Writing Centers</li>
</ul>
<h4>Questions about the course itself</h4>
<p>If you have questions about how the course is run, a due date, grading criteria, things like that, the first place to look is the course materials, such as the syllabus and the assignment instructions. Make sure you have checked these before posing a question! If you cannot find your answer in the materials, look in <a title="Hallway Conversations" href="$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/discussion_topics/gcac6604b5197323c619e19086dbe144f" data-api-endpoint="https://asu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/105269/discussion_topics/2964611" data-api-returntype="Discussion">Hallway Conversations</a>. Perhaps someone else has asked the same question. If your question isn't already there (please check first!), then start a new thread in <a title="Hallway Conversations" href="$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/discussion_topics/gcac6604b5197323c619e19086dbe144f" data-api-endpoint="https://asu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/105269/discussion_topics/2964611" data-api-returntype="Discussion">Hallway Conversations</a> and ask it! You can also post in <a title="Hallway Conversations" href="$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/discussion_topics/gcac6604b5197323c619e19086dbe144f" data-api-endpoint="https://asu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/105269/discussion_topics/2964611" data-api-returntype="Discussion">Hallway Conversations</a> if you need clarification on a lesson, or if something you came across in the readings seems confusing. As long as the question is of a general nature, feel free to use the <a title="Hallway Conversations" href="$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/discussion_topics/gcac6604b5197323c619e19086dbe144f" data-api-endpoint="https://asu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/105269/discussion_topics/2964611" data-api-returntype="Discussion">Hallway Conversations</a>.</p>
<h4>Questions about personal matters, such as grades</h4>
<p>If you need to ask why you received a certain grade, or to negotiate a due date extension, or something of a personal nature like that, it is not appropriate to use the Q &amp; A Forum, as that is a public space. Instead, you should email your instructor directly.</p>
<h4>Questions about using Canvas, or help with resolving a technological problem</h4>
<p>The instructor of the course may not have the expertise to assist you with technical glitches. For things like computer problems or Canvas failures, call or email the <strong>ASU Help Desk</strong>. The Help Desk can provide immediate technical assistance, and they are available 24 hours, 7 days a week, at <strong>1-855-278-5080</strong>. They can also provide verification of technical problems, if you need to provide proof to your instructor. You can also visit <a href="https://my.asu.edu/service" target="new">https://my.asu.edu/service</a> for online help articles and/or to submit an online help request.</p>
<h4>Questions about writing format and grammar</h4>
<p>Learning how to write in APA style can be challenging. Your instructor could help you with that, but it is more appropriate for you to seek help from the <strong>ASU Writing Centers</strong>, which are a free service for ASU students. The Writing Centers can also help you spot and correct grammar errors before you turn in your paper.</p>
