<p>The discussion boards are a hugely valuable tool for everyone in that it can allow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Others to benefit from the answers we receive to our questions</strong> (it's rare for anyone to be the only person with a question).</li>
<li>
<strong>Someone with a problem to get help faster</strong> (I try to answer questions as soon as I can, but I can't answer as fast as everyone can).</li>
<li>
<strong>Students to learn by helping others</strong> (a common saying with teachers is that you don't truly understand something until you can explain it to others).</li>
</ul>
<p>So I encourage you to try the discussion boards first with your questions and let's see if we can create a supporting community for the course.</p>
<p>Best practices when posting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Try hard not to ask the same question again.</strong> Read over the posts broadly before asking a new question. By not posting the same question multiple times, the discussion board will be easy to search and find answers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Be as specific and detailed as possible.</strong> It is really hard to help someone who "Can't upload the assignment." It is much easier to help someone who "Gets an error message that says X when trying to submit assignment Y while using Firefox on my Windows 10 PC after doing the assignment in Cloud9."</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't pile on</strong> - Multiple replies and posts of "Me too" are generally not productive.</li>
<li>
<strong>Strive to be extra courteous.</strong> It is very easy for a comment to be interpreted poorly. Remember, you are all hear to learn new skills, be respectful when replying.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said...</p>
<p>1. As with any type of technology, there are bound to be issues. <em><strong>If the discussion boards become a source of constant complaints and negativity, they will be disabledâ€”no questions asked.</strong></em></p>
<p>2. I expect you to uphold the academic integrity policies and the policies of the course when interacting with your fellow classmates in the discussion boards. Web design and development can and should be collaborative (even when you are working on your own separate projects). However, there are limitation to what being collaborative means. Remember "be reasonable" and go back over the <a title="Step 1: Understand Academic Integrity in CIS 300 &amp; W. P. Carey Honor Code" href="$WIKI_REFERENCE$/pages/ga86174892dbc5faf2c066d3cc7875656">course policies in the Start Here</a> guide to make sure you know what falls into each category. <em><strong>DO NOT discuss the quizzes or provide complete copies of your work.</strong></em></p>
<p>Other Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to get email notifications for forum posts, look for a Subscribe button for the forum. Sadly you cannot respond to posts via email but you can at least get them quickly (e.g. to be notified when your question gets a response). If this email traffic becomes too much, most email clients allow you to filter your emails off into a side folder.</li>
<li>Use the <a title="Hallway Conversations" href="$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/discussion_topics/gcac6604b5197323c619e19086dbe144f">Hallway Conversations</a> forum for general questions and the <a title="Discussions" href="$CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE$/discussion_topics" data-api-endpoint="https://asu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/19999/discussion_topics" data-api-returntype="[Discussion]">Week X discussion</a> for questions specific to that week's content.</li>
</ul>
