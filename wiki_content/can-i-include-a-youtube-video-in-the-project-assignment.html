<p>Yes, a YouTube video can be embedded in the project assignment.&nbsp; However, the project assignment is required to include a video tag in one of the html files.&nbsp; So a youtube video can be embedded but will NOT be counted as the video points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find any video online or create your own video to be used with the video tag.&nbsp; If you will create your own video, make sure it is less than 1 minute so we won't run into any problems in the final project submission.&nbsp; The larger file does take longer time to be submitted.&nbsp; The video should be in the mp4 format or any other formats that Chrome supports.&nbsp; A poster image is highly recommended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the video, included in the video tag, you can embed a YouTube video in the project assignment with the iframe tag.&nbsp; An iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.&nbsp; More info about iframe can be found at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp</a></p>
