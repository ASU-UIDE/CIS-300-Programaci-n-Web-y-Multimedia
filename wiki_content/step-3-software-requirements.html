<h4><strong>CIS 300 Software Requirements:</strong></h4>
<p>As you can probably tell by now, CIS 300 relies heavily on a computer. The first piece of software that you will need is an up-to-date internet browser. I'm going to assume you have the latest version of your internet browser, but just check and make sure. I personally have found Firefox and Chrome to work best with the course materials.</p>
<p>For the final project, there are 7 deliverables that will require you to use Microsoft Office (you'll need to open and submit *.doc or *.docx files for some of the work). Currently enrolled students can use and install this software on up to 5 compatible PCs and Macs, plus 5 tablets (including iPad) for free (yep FOR FREE) through your enrollment at ASU.</p>
<p><strong>The software you can use to work on the project assignments are MS Word or Google Docs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please do NOT submit .pages file because the content of the file may not be opened properly by the Windows computers. Points will be deducted in that case. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Optional:</strong> To get your Microsoft Office 365, follow these simple steps:</p>
<p>1. Go to <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com" target="_blank"><span>https://login.microsoftonline.com</span></a> and enter the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username: your Office 365 username (i.e., ASURITE@sundevils.asu.edu)<br>NOTE: ASURITE@sundevils.asu is used only for Office 365 login, installation or reauthentaction</li>
<li>Password: Password you use to log into your My ASU account</li>
<li>Select the "Student" radio button and click “Sign in” button</li>
<li>Sign in using your ASURITE@asu.edu and password on the login screen</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Follow the instructions on the installation screen.</p>
<h4><strong>Introduction to Microsoft Azure:</strong></h4>
<p>ASU and Microsoft have teamed up to provide free software to students through the <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> program. If you do not have Microsoft Windows 7 or higher, please watch the video below to see how you can download Microsoft Windows for free.</p>
<p><strong>***You may not have access to prior to the date the course starts. If you search My Apps for Microsoft Azure prior the course start date and no results are found, please try back again after the course officially starts.***</strong></p>
<p>*The Microsoft Windows installers come in an *.ISO format. If you need assistance with the installation, please contact the ASU UTO Help Desk for assistance.</p>
