<p>Depending on your file size, it may take Canvas up to 1 1/2 hours to finish uploading your final project assignment (1 Word document plus a zipped file for all your HTML and CSS files)</p>
<p>Canvas will not provide any progress status info so make sure you budget enough time to submit your final project assignment.</p>
<p>To reduce the submission time, you can just make a 10-20 seconds and no more than 1 minute video. Any big size videos should be uploaded to YouTube and include them in your website with iframe tag not video tag. However, for the final project assignment, video tag is required. Please also make sure your image files are smaller than 150 KB.</p>
<p>As an alternative, you can submit the word doc in one submission and the zipped file in another. Please add a note so the grader and I know to find the word doc or the zipped HTML/CSS file in another submission. Even though you totally have three submissions for submitting the final project assignment, we only grade your last submission unless you provided a note to let us know to find a file from another submission.</p>
