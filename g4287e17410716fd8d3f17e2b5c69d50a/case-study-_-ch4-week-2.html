</head>
<body>
<p><strong>Pacific Trails Resort</strong></p>
<p>Throughout this course you will need to complete the <strong>Pacific Trails Resort</strong> case study at the end of each chapter. These case studies serve as a way to reinforce the skills discussed within each chapter. At the end of each week, you will be required to create a ZIP file of your case study folder and submit it via the submission link below. Each chapter's case study (FYI - Not all chapters have an end of chapter case study) will build upon the previous chapter's case study files. You will need to submit the LAST chapter of the week's case study files when you submit or you will not get full credit.</p>
<p>Solutions videos to the prior week's case studies will be posted the following week. Please review the solution video and make sure you correct your files as needed.</p>
